AI Cognitive Classification Project

This project focused on developing a machine learning-based solution for classifying educational questions ac- cording to Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, an essential framework in the educational domain for categorizing educational objectives. Uti- lizing advanced data preprocessing methods, including Word2Vec embeddings and TF-IDF vectorization, alongside a range of machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, KNN, SVM with linear and RBF kernels, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression), the study aimed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automatic question classification. The results demonstrated high accuracy across most models, with SVM and Logistic Regression showing particularly promising performance. This work not only contributes to the field of educational technology by providing an effective tool for automatic question categorization but also sets a benchmark for future explorations into the application of machine learning in educational data analysis.
